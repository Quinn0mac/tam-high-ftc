# Tam High FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Club

Welcome! This is the repository for the Tamalpais Union High School District
FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Club! Whew, that's a mouthfull.
The Tam High FTC Robotics Club for short.

If you're not a member of the club, feel free to poke around,
but this is mainly for internal use!

## Getting Started

FIRST recommends going through the (Blocks Tutorial)[https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial]
as your first introduction to programming your FTC Robot.
If you're already comfortable with programming,
especially with Java,
you could also move directly to the (OnBot Java)[https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial]
or (Android Studio)[https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Android-Studio-Tutorial] tutorials.
